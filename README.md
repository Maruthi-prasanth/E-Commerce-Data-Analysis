Abstract


This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data using Big Data technologies like Apache Hive, Power BI, and Python-based EDA techniques. The project extracts meaningful insights from large datasets, visualizes business trends, and optimizes decision-making processes.



Dataset


The project uses e-commerce transaction datasets containing details like customer purchases, product categories, sales trends, and revenue generation. The data undergoes cleaning, transformation, and aggregation to derive valuable insights.



Objective


The primary goal is to analyze e-commerce data to:


Identify sales trends across different product categories.
Understand customer purchasing behavior.
Generate interactive visualizations for better business insights.
Perform data-driven decision-making using Big Data tools.



Data Processing


Hive Queries


ðŸ“„ File: Hive Queries.docx
This document contains SQL-like queries for Apache Hive to:


Clean and preprocess raw data.
Aggregate sales, revenue, and customer segmentation.
Perform trend analysis on product demand and seasonal variations.



Visualization
