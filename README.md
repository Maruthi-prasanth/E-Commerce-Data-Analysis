📖 Abstract


This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data using Big Data technologies like Apache Hive, Power BI, and Python-based EDA techniques. The project extracts meaningful insights from large datasets, visualizes business trends, and optimizes decision-making processes.



📂 Dataset


The project uses e-commerce transaction datasets containing details like customer purchases, product categories, sales trends, and revenue generation. The data undergoes cleaning, transformation, and aggregation to derive valuable insights.



🎯 Objective


The primary goal is to analyze e-commerce data to:


📌 Identify sales trends across different product categories.
🛒 Understand customer purchasing behavior.
📈 Generate interactive visualizations for better business insights.
🔍 Perform data-driven decision-making using Big Data tools.



🛠 Data Processing


📌 Hive Queries (Hive Queries.docx)


This document contains SQL-like queries for Apache Hive to:


🧹 Clean and preprocess raw data.
📊 Aggregate sales, revenue, and customer segmentation.
📈 Perform trend analysis on product demand and seasonal variations.



📊 Visualization


📌 Power BI Visualization (PowerBi Viusalization.docx)


This document provides a step-by-step guide on creating interactive dashboards using Power BI:


🔗 Connecting Power BI to the transformed dataset.
📊 Creating visualizations such as sales trends, revenue distribution, and customer behavior.
🎯 Extracting insights for data-driven business decisions.



🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
