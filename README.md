# E-Commerce-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing large-scale e-commerce data to extract meaningful insights using Big Data technologies and data visualization tools. The analysis helps in understanding customer behavior, product sales trends, and market dynamics to aid data-driven decision-making.

Maruthi-Prasanth E-Commerce Data Analysis


Project Overview


This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data using Big Data technologies such as Apache Hive and Power BI. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from large datasets, visualize trends, and optimize business decisions.


Key Features:


Data Processing: Hive queries to transform and extract insights from raw e-commerce data.
Data Visualization: Power BI dashboards for interactive analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted using Jupyter Notebook with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.).

Project Details


1. Hive Queries (Hive Queries.docx)


This document contains SQL-like queries for Apache Hive to process and analyze e-commerce transaction data. Some key operations include:


Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Aggregation of sales, revenue, and customer demographics.
Trend analysis of product categories and seasonal demand.


2. Power BI Visualization (PowerBi Viusalization.docx)


This document explains how to use Power BI to create interactive dashboards from the processed data. It includes:


Steps to connect Power BI to the processed dataset.
Sample visualizations such as sales trends, customer segmentation, and revenue distribution.
Insights derived from visualization to aid business decision-making.


3. Jupyter Notebook (r.ipynb)


This Python-based notebook contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) scripts using Pandas and Matplotlib. It includes:


Data loading and preprocessing.
Statistical analysis and feature engineering.
Visualization of key metrics such as sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
